Tagline: A web application to help pet owners find their lost pets.
Team:
Favour kingsley (Project Manager/Backend Developer,Frontend Developer,UI/UX Designer,Database Administrator)

i chose these roles because they align with my strengths and interests in order to effectively complete the project.

Technologies:
Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask, Bootstrap
Libraries: jQuery
Database: PostgreSQL
Deployment: Heroku
Testing: pytest
For database, i considered using MongoDB as an alternative to PostgreSQL. The trade-off was that MongoDB is more flexible with unstructured data but less effective when dealing with complex queries. We chose PostgreSQL because my projects requires complex queries and it is also more widely used in the industry.

For deployment, i also considered AWS but chose Heroku because it offers an easier setup process and better support for Python.

Challenge:
The FindMyPet project is intended to solve the problem of lost pets. Many pet owners experience the distress of losing their pets and are unsure of how to go about finding them. The web application will allow pet owners to create an account, report their lost pet, and view a map of nearby sightings of similar pets. The application will not solve the problem of pets getting lost, but will aid in the recovery process for pet owners.

The FindMyPet project will help pet owners who have lost their pets by providing them with a platform to report and view sightings of similar pets in the area. The users of the application will be pet owners who have lost their pets or individuals who have found lost pets.

This project is relevant to any locale with pet owners and lost pets.

Risks:
Technical risks include the integration of the Flask and PostgreSQL frameworks and ensuring data privacy and security. To mitigate these risks, we will conduct regular code reviews and use encryption for sensitive data.

Non-technical risks include team member availability and communication. We will address these risks by establishing a clear timeline and communication plan, and regularly checking in with each other.

Infrastructure:
my process for branching and merging in my repository will follow the GitHub flow strategy.i will work on my own  branch and submit a pull request for review before merging with the main branch.my strategy for deployment is to use Heroku, which will automatically deploy our application from the main branch in our GitHub repository.i will populate my app app with data through a combination of user input and public data sources.
For testing, i will use pytest and perform manual testing to ensure the application is functioning as expected.

Existing Solutions:
Similar products or solutions that currently exist include:
PawBoost: a website and mobile app that allows pet owners to report lost pets and search for found pets in their area. Similar to our project, PawBoost allows users to create an account and view sightings of similar pets in the area. However, our project will have a more streamlined user interface and additional features such as a map view of nearby sightings.
Finding Rover: a mobile app that uses facial recognition technology to help reunite lost pets with their owners. While this is a unique approach, it may not be as effective for pets that do not have distinct facial features. Additionally, our project is more accessible as it is available on both desktop and mobile devices.
We intend to reimplement similar features from these existing solutions but with additional enhancements to improve the user experience and functionality.
